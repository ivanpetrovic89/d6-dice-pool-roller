# d6-dice-pool-roller

**This is my dice roller. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My dice roller is my beginner JS project. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.**

Without me, my dice roller is useless. Without my dice roller, I am useless. 
I must fire my dice roller true. I must roll higher than my enemy who is trying to outplay me. I must outroll him before he outrolls me. I will...

My dice roller and I know that what counts in every campaign is not the dice we roll, the noise of our burst, or the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit DC or over ...

My dice roller is human, even as I [am human], because it is my life. Thus, I will roll it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strengths, its parts, its accessories, its odds, and its chances. I will keep my dice roller clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will ...

Before God, I swear this creed. My dice roller and I are the defenders of my campaign. We are the masters of our players. We are the saviors of roleplaying.

So be it, until victory is ours and there are no more BBEGs, but peace!

d6-dice-pool-roller is made for my ttrpg. It uses a simple d6 dice pool system.
You gather a bunch of d6 die (depending on your character's skill), the GM states the difficulty, and the player rolls. Every d6 that has 1-3 counts as a fail, and every d6 that has 4-6 counts as a pass. If you have equal or more passes than difficulty, your task is a success.

My friends always struggle to understand the rules of dice pool systems because they are low IQ d20 nerds, so I made this dice roller to ease their pain.

Since this is my first JS project, I have no idea what I'm doing. I just followed the [Bro Code's - Build this JavaScript Dice Roller program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXilNmL9U80) and expanded basic functionality to suit my needs.

There's one mega method in index.js called rollDice() in which I made the whole functionality of the roller. It looks bad, but it's functional - no hate pls.
index.html has a structure, and style.css has - style. You know, all basic stuff.

To start the roller on your local machine, open the project in VS Code, get the Live Server extension if you don't have it, right-click on the index.html, and click on the 'Open with Live Server'. The dice roller will open in your default browser.

I have no idea how to start it from any other code editor. Sorry.
